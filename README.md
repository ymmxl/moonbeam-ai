MoonbeamAI is a sophisticated financial news sentiment analysis system that generates real-time trading signals by processing financial headlines through a multi-agent AI pipeline. The system combines advanced NLP sentiment analysis with ticker extraction and temporal aggregation to produce actionable trading insights.

## üéØ Strategy & Vision

### Trading Strategy
The core hypothesis behind MoonbeamAI is that **aggregate sentiment trends from financial news can predict short-term price movements**. The system:

1. **Captures Market Sentiment**: Processes real-time financial news to extract sentiment signals
2. **Temporal Aggregation**: Uses an 8-hour rolling window to smooth out noise and identify trends
3. **Multi-Signal Analysis**: Combines sentiment strength, confidence scores, and headline frequency
4. **Risk Management**: Applies configurable thresholds to reduce false signals

### Investment Philosophy
- **Data-Driven Decisions**: Every signal is backed by quantitative sentiment analysis
- **Trend Following**: Focus on momentum rather than contrarian plays
- **Risk-Aware**: Conservative thresholds prioritize signal quality over quantity
- **Scalable**: Architecture supports processing thousands of news articles daily

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

MoonbeamAI uses a **multi-agent pipeline architecture** where specialized AI agents handle different aspects of the analysis:

```
üì∞ News Sources ‚Üí ü§ñ Agent Pipeline ‚Üí üìä Trading Signals
```

### Core Components

#### 1. **News Ingestion Layer**
- **TickerTick Integration**: Real-time financial news with pre-extracted tickers (powered by [TickerTick API](https://github.com/hczhu/TickerTick-API))
- **Google News Fallback**: Alternative news source for broader coverage
- **Headline Simulator**: Synthetic data for testing and development

#### 2. **AI Agent Pipeline**
- **Headline Classifier Agent**: Sentiment analysis using NER and transformer models
- **Sentiment Aggregator Agent**: Temporal aggregation with confidence weighting
- **Signal Decision Agent**: Converts sentiment trends into trading signals

#### 3. **System Coordinator**
- Orchestrates data flow between agents
- Manages system state and configuration
- Handles real-time broadcasting to clients

#### 4. **API Layer**
- **FastAPI Backend**: High-performance async API with WebSocket support
- **Flask Frontend**: Alternative web interface for legacy compatibility
- **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket connections for live signal streaming

## üíª Usage

### API Endpoints

#### Core Endpoints
```bash
# Process a single headline
POST /process-headline
{
  "headline": "Apple reports record Q4 earnings, beats expectations"
}

# Get latest trading signals
GET /latest-signals

# Get signals for specific ticker
GET /signals-by-ticker

# Get signal history
GET /signal-history

# Manual news fetch
POST /fetch-news
```

#### WebSocket Connection
```javascript
const ws = new WebSocket('ws://localhost:8000/ws');
ws.onmessage = (event) => {
    const data = JSON.parse(event.data);
    if (data.type === 'signals') {
        console.log('New signals:', data.data);
    }
};
```

### Python Integration

```python
import asyncio
from system_coordinator import SystemCoordinator

# Initialize the system
coordinator = SystemCoordinator()

# Process a headline
async def analyze_news():
    signals = await coordinator.process_headline(
        "Tesla stock surges on strong delivery numbers"
    )
    print(f"Generated signals: {signals}")

# Run the analysis
asyncio.run(analyze_news())
```

### Configuration

Create a `.env` file for configuration:
```bash
# News Source Configuration
USE_TICKERTICK_NEWS=true
NEWS_FETCH_INTERVAL=180

# Sentiment Analysis
USE_ALPHA_VANTAGE_SENTIMENT=false

# API Keys (optional)
ALPHA_VANTAGE_API_KEY=your_key_here
```

## üß™ Testing

Run the test suite:
```bash
# Run all tests
python -m pytest tests/

# Run specific test categories
python -m pytest tests/test_api_endpoints.py
python -m pytest tests/test_fastapi_integration.py
```

## üìä Signal Interpretation

### Signal Types
- **LONG**: Positive sentiment trend, consider buying
- **SHORT**: Negative sentiment trend, consider selling  
- **FLAT**: Neutral or insufficient data, no action recommended

### Confidence Levels
- **High (0.8-1.0)**: Strong signal backed by multiple high-confidence headlines
- **Medium (0.6-0.8)**: Moderate signal with some uncertainty
- **Low (0.0-0.6)**: Weak signal, use with caution

### Example Signal Output
```json
{
  "AAPL": {
    "signal": "LONG",
    "confidence": 0.85,
    "sentiment_score": 0.73,
    "headline_count": 12,
    "last_updated": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
  }
}
```

## üîß Configuration

### Agent Configuration
The system supports various configuration options:

```python
# Sentiment Aggregator
window_minutes = 8 * 60  # 8-hour rolling window
confidence_threshold = 0.1

# Signal Decision
positive_threshold = 0.7  # Threshold for LONG signals
negative_threshold = -0.7  # Threshold for SHORT signals
min_headlines = 2  # Minimum headlines required
```
